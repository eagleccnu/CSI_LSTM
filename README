This program is to predict protein secondary structure based on NMR chemical shifts of protein.
The NMR chemical shifts is provided by NMRSTAR file (see BMRB website).

To run this program, python and some python modules should be setup: pytorch, numpy, scikit-learn, pandas, and pynmrstar.

usage: python pred_on_nmrstar_v2.py NMRSTAR_file

sample: python pred_on_nmrstar_v2.py 2jxp_15568_v3.str
